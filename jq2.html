	jQuery is a lightweight , "write less, do more" , JavaScript library.
The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.
jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.
jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.
The jQuery library contains the following features:
HTML/DOM manipulation
CSS manipulation
HTML event methods
Effects and animations
AJAX
Utilities
